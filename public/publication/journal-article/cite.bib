	abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs). SW-CRTs include several design variations and methodology is rapidly developing. Accordingly, a variety of power and sample size calculation software for SW-CRTs has been developed. However, each calculator may support only a selected set of design features and may not be appropriate for all scenarios. Currently, there is no resource to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate calculator for planning their trials. In this paper, we review and classify 18 existing calculators that can be implemented in major platforms, such as R, SAS, Stata, Microsoft Excel, PASS and nQuery. After reviewing the main sample size considerations for SW-CRTs, we summarize the features supported by the available calculators, including the types of designs, outcomes, correlation structures and treatment effects; whether incomplete designs, cluster-size variation or secular trends are accommodated; and the analytical approach used. We then discuss in more detail four main calculators and identify their strengths and limitations. We illustrate how to use these four calculators to compute power for two real SW-CRTs with a continuous and binary outcome and compare the results. We show that the choice of calculator can make a substantial difference in the calculated power and explain these differences. Finally, we make recommendations for implementing sample size or power calculations using the available calculators. An R Shiny app is available for users to select the calculator that meets their requirements (https://douyang.shinyapps.io/swcrtcalculator/).},

	abstract = {In a cluster-randomized trial (CRT), the number of participants enrolled often varies across clusters. This variation should be considered during both trial design and data analysis to ensure statistical performance goals are achieved. Most methodological literature on the CRT design has assumed equal cluster sizes. This scoping review focuses on methodology for unequal cluster size CRTs. EMBASE, Medline, Google Scholar, MathSciNet and Web of Science databases were searched to identify English-language articles reporting on methodology for unequal cluster size CRTs published until March 2021. We extracted data on the focus of the paper (power calculation, Type I error etc.), the type of CRT, the type and the range of parameter values investigated (number of clusters, mean cluster size, cluster size coefficient of variation, intra-cluster correlation coefficient, etc.), and the main conclusions. Seventy-nine of 5032 identified papers met the inclusion criteria. Papers primarily focused on the parallel-arm CRT (p-CRT, n = 60, 76\%) and the stepped-wedge CRT (n = 14, 18\%). Roughly 75\% of the papers addressed trial design issues (sample size/power calculation) while 25\% focused on analysis considerations (Type I error, bias, etc.). The ranges of parameter values explored varied substantially across different studies. Methods for accounting for unequal cluster sizes in the p-CRT have been investigated extensively for Gaussian and binary outcomes. Synthesizing the findings of these works is difficult as the magnitude of impact of the unequal cluster sizes varies substantially across the combinations and ranges of input parameters. Limited investigations have been done for other combinations of a CRT design by outcome type, particularly methodology involving binary outcomesâ€”the most commonly used type of primary outcome in trials. The paucity of methodological papers outside of the p-CRT with Gaussian or binary outcomes highlights the need for further methodological development to fill the gaps.},

Trial power, as calculated using standard software, is an expected power that arises from averaging hypothetical trial results over all possible treatment allocations that could be generated by the randomization algorithm. However, in the trial that ultimately is conducted, only one treatment allocation will occur, and the corresponding attained power (conditional on the allocation that occurred) is not guaranteed to be equal to the expected power and may be substantially lower. We provide examples illustrating this issue, discuss some circumstances when this issue is a concern, define and advocate the examination of the pre-randomization power distribution for evaluating the risk of obtaining unacceptably low attained power, and suggest the use of randomization restrictions to reduce this risk. In trials that randomize only a modest number of units, we recommend that trial designers evaluate the risk of getting low attained power and, if warranted, modify the randomization algorithm to reduce this risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The attained power, calculated conditional on the realized allocation, of a clinical trial may differ from the expected power, obtained pre-randomization through averaging over all potential allocations that could be generated by the randomization algorithm (RA). For example, a two-arm trial using a RA that is expected to allocate 20 participants to each arm will attain less than the expected power if by chance it allocates 25 and 15 participants to the arms. Cluster randomized trials with unequal cluster sizes have elevated risk of realizing an allocation that yields an attained power much lower than the expected power when modest numbers of clusters are randomized.
METHOD: We developed the R package CRTpowerdist, which implements both simulations and approximate analytic formulae to calculate the attained powers associated with different realized allocations and constructs the pre-randomization power distribution associated with the RA to facilitate assessing the risk of obtaining inadequate power. The package covers unequal cluster-size, cross-sectional stepped-wedge and parallel cluster randomized trials, with or without stratification. Allowed outcome types are: continuous (Gaussian), binary (Binomial) and count (Poisson). The analytic formulae-based calculations are also implemented in a Shiny app.
RESULTS: The functionality of the CRTpowerdist is illustrated for each type of trial design. The examples show how to obtain the attained power, the power distribution, and the risk of low attained power, using both simulation and analytic formulae.
CONCLUSION: For cluster randomized trials with unequal cluster sizes, the CRTpowerdist package can assist users in identifying an appropriate randomization algorithm by enabling the user to assess the risk that a randomization algorithm will lead to an allocation with inadequate attained power. The Shiny app makes these assessments accessible to researchers who are unable or do not wish to use the CRTpowerdist package.},

	abstract = {BackgroundIn a cross-sectional stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial comparing usual care to a new intervention, treatment allocation and time are correlated by design because participants enrolled early in the trial predominantly receive usual care while those enrolled late in the trial predominantly receive the new intervention. Current guidelines recommend adjustment for time effects when analyzing stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials to remove the confounding bias induced by this correlation. However, adjustment for time effects impacts study power. Within the Frequentist framework, adopting a sample size calculation that includes time effects would ensure the trial having adequate power regardless of the magnitude of the effect of time on the outcome. But if in fact time effects were negligible, this would overestimate the required sample size and could lead to the trial being deemed infeasible due to cost or unavailability of the required numbers of clusters or participants. In this study, we explore the use of prior information on time effects to potentially reduce the required sample size of the trial.MethodsWe applied a Bayesian approach to incorporate the prior information on the time effects into cluster-level statistical models (for continuous, binary, or count outcomes) for the stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. We conducted simulations to illustrate how the bias in the intervention effect estimate and the trial power vary as a function of the prior precision and the mis-specification of the prior means of the time effects in an example scenario.ResultsWhen a nearly flat prior for the time effects was used, the power or sample size calculated using the Bayesian approach matched the result obtained using the Frequentist approach with time effects included. When a highly precise prior for the time effects (with accurately specified prior means) was used, the Bayesian result matched the Frequentist result obtained with time effects excluded. When the prior means of the time effects were nearly correctly specified, including this information improved the efficiency of the trial with little bias introduced into the intervention effect estimate. When the prior means of the time effects were greatly mis-specified and a precise prior was used, this bias was substantial.ConclusionIncluding prior information on time effects using a Bayesian approach may substantially reduce the required sample size. When the prior can be justified, results from applying this approach could support the conduct of a trial, which would be deemed infeasible if based on the larger sample size obtained using a Frequentist calculation. Caution is warranted as biased intervention effect estimates may arise when the prior distribution for the time effects is concentrated far from their true values.},

	abstract = {When the optimal treatment duration is uncertain, a randomized trial may allocate patients to receive active treatment for different durations. We use an example where patients receive treatment for 0, 24, or 52 weeks. In this trial, patients in the 24-weeks and 52-weeks arms receive the same treatment during the first 24 weeks. This overlap allows for more powerful analyses than conventional pair-wise comparisons of arms. When the outcome is the time-to-event, the power for the 0-weeks versus 24-weeks comparison can be increased by including patients in the 52-weeks arm as patients in the 24-weeks arm for the first 24 weeks and censoring at 24 weeks. Furthermore, differences observed between the 24-weeks and 52-weeks arms during the first 24 weeks can only reflect noise. Hence, the comparison of these two arms should be restricted to only patients who remain on the study at 24 weeks and include only the events after 24 weeks. Through simulation, we show that modified analyses accounting for these considerations increase study power substantially. Moreover, if patients were allocated equally to the arms, then events or discontinuations during the first 24 weeks will reduce the number of patients available for the 24-weeks versus 52-weeks comparison, and hence the power of this analysis will be lower than that for the 0-weeks versus 24-weeks comparison. We present a sample size calculation procedure for equalizing the power of these two analyses. Typically, this allocation requires much larger sample sizes in the 24-weeks and 52-weeks arms than in the 0-week arm.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Secondary analysis of an existing database of primary trial reports published during 2014-2019, registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, self-labelled as pragmatic and with target and achieved sample sizes available.
RESULTS: Of 372 eligible trials, the prevalence of under-recruitment (achieving {\textless}90\% of target sample size) was 71 (19.1\%) and of over-recruitment ({\textgreater}110\% of target) was 87 (23.4\%). Under-recruiting trials commonly acknowledged that they did not achieve their targets (51, 71.8\%), with the majority providing an explanation, but only 11 (12.6\%) over-recruiting trials acknowledged recruitment excess. The prevalence of under-recruitment in individually randomised versus cluster randomised trials was 41 (17.0\%) and 30 (22.9\%), respectively; prevalence of over-recruitment was 39 (16.2\%) vs 48 (36.7\%), respectively. Overall, 101â€‰025 participants were recruited to trials that did not achieve at least 90\% of their target sample size. When considering trials with over-recruitment, the total number of participants recruited in excess of the target was a median (Q1-Q3) 319 (75-1478) per trial for an overall total of 555â€‰309 more participants than targeted. In multinomial logistic regression, cluster randomisation and lower journal impact factor were significantly associated with both under-recruitment and over-recruitment, while using exclusively routinely collected data and educational/behavioural interventions were significantly associated with over-recruitment; we were unable to detect significant associations with obtaining consent, publication year, country of recruitment or public engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: A clear explanation for under-recruitment or over-recruitment in pragmatic trials should be provided to encourage transparency in research, and to inform recruitment to future trials with comparable designs. The issues and ethical implications of over-recruitment should be more widely recognised by trialists, particularly when designing cluster randomised trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insertion of a central venous access device (CVAD) allows clinicians to easily access the circulation of a patient to administer life-saving interventions. Due to their invasive nature, CVADs are prone to complications such as bacterial biofilm production and colonization, catheter-related bloodstream infection, occlusion, and catheter-related venous thrombosis. A CVAD is among the most common interventions for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), exposing this vulnerable population to the risk of nosocomial infection and catheter occlusion. The current standard of care involves the use of normal saline as a catheter locking solution for central venous catheters (CVCs) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines, and a citrate lock for hemodialysis catheters. Saline offers little prophylactic measures against catheter complications. Four percent of tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) fluid (marketed as KiteLock Sterile Locking Solutionâ„¢) is non-antibiotic, possesses antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, and anti-coagulant properties, and is approved by Health Canada as a catheter locking solution. As such, it may be a superior CVAD locking solution than the present standard of care lock in the ICU patient population.
METHODS: Our team proposes to fill this knowledge gap by performing a multi-center, cluster-randomized, crossover trial evaluating the impact of 4\% tetrasodium EDTA on a primary composite outcome of the incidence rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter occlusion leading to removal, and use of alteplase to resolve catheter occlusion compared to the standard of care. The study will be performed at five critical care units.
DISCUSSION: If successful, the results of this study can serve as evidence for a shift of standard of care practices to include EDTA locking fluid in routine CVAD locking procedures. Completion of this study has the potential to improve CVAD standard of care to become safer for patients, as well as provides an opportunity to decrease strain on healthcare budgets related to treating preventable CVAD complications. Success and subsequent implementation of this intervention in the ICU may also be extrapolated to other patient populations with heavy CVAD use including hemodialysis, oncology, parenteral nutrition, and pediatric patient populations. On a global scale, eradicating biofilm produced by antibiotic-resistant bacteria may serve to lessen the threat of "superbugs" and contribute to international initiatives supporting the termination of antibiotic overuse.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Learners, either medical students or residents, often perform the initial assessment of patients visiting the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, if learners affect the rate of short-term unscheduled return visits. The objective of this study was to determine if the involvement of learners in ED visits increases the rate of return visits.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of ED visit data at a single tertiary care centre over a 1-year period. Return visits were defined as those presenting within 72Â h of discharge from an initial non-admit ED visit and resulting in an admission on the second visit. A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine the odds ratios of return visits, adjusting for prespecified co-variates, with and without learners involved during the initial visit. Secondary analyses assessed for associations between learner level of training, program of study and return visits.
RESULTS: Return visits occurred after 658 (1.3\%) of 51,149 encounters involving learners and 701 (0.8\%) of 83,310 encounters with no learner involvement. Involvement of learners in ED initial visits was not associated with increased odds of return visits (adjusted OR 1.13 [95\% CI 0.71-1.81]), although the point estimates were heterogeneous over learner level of training, with clerkship students (medical student years 3 and 4) and senior residents (post-graduate years 4 and 5) trending towards reduced odds of a return visit. Resident program of study did not independently predict return visits.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the involvement of learners in ED patient assessments is not associated with increased odds of short-term unscheduled return visits.},

	abstract = {Background
Adults â‰¥Â 65 are at risk of cervical spine (C-spine) injury, even after low-level falls. The objectives of this systematic review were to determine the prevalence of C-spine injury in this population and explore the association of unreliable clinical exam with C-spine injury.
Methods
We conducted this systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews to include studies reporting on C-spine injury in adults â‰¥Â 65Â years after low-level falls. Two reviewers independently screened articles, abstracted data, and assessed bias. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate overall prevalence and the pooled odds ratio for the association between C-spine injury and an unreliable clinical exam.
Results
The search identified 2044citations, 138 full texts were screened, and 21 studies were included in the systematic review. C-spine injury prevalence in adults â‰¥Â 65Â years after low-level falls was 3.8\% (95\% CI: 2.8â€“5.3). The odds of c-spine injury in those with altered level of consciousness (aLOC) v/s not aLOC was 1.21 (0.90â€“1.63) and in those with GCSÂ {\textless}Â 15 v/s GCS 15 was 1.62 (0.37â€“6.98). Studies were at a low-risk of bias, although some had low recruitment and significant loss to follow-up.
Conclusions
Adults â‰¥Â 65Â years are at risk of cervical spine injury after low-level falls. More research is needed to determine whether there is an association between cervical spine injury and GCSÂ {\textless}Â 15 or altered level of consciousness.},

A key requirement for appropriate design and analysis of longitudinal CRTs is accounting for the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC). In addition to exchangeable correlation (constant ICC over time), correlation structures proposed for longitudinal CRT are block exchangeable (allows a different within- and between-period ICC) and exponential decay (allows between-period ICC to decay exponentially). More flexible correlation structures are available in statistical software packages and, although not formally proposed for longitudinal CRTs, may offer some advantages. Our objectives were to empirically explore the impact of these correlation structures on treatment effect inferences, identify gaps in the methodological literature, and make practical recommendations.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that designing a cluster randomized trial (CRT) requires an advance estimate of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC). In the case of longitudinal CRTs, where outcomes are assessed repeatedly in each cluster over time, estimates for more complex correlation structures are required. Three common types of correlation structures for longitudinal CRTs are exchangeable, nested/block exchangeable and exponential decay correlations-the latter two allow the strength of the correlation to weaken over time. Determining sample sizes under these latter two structures requires advance specification of the within-period ICC and cluster autocorrelation coefficient as well as the intra-individual autocorrelation coefficient in the case of a cohort design. How to estimate these coefficients is a common challenge for investigators. When appropriate estimates from previously published longitudinal CRTs are not available, one possibility is to re-analyse data from an available trial dataset or to access observational data to estimate these parameters in advance of a trial. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to estimate correlation parameters under these correlation structures for continuous and binary outcomes. We first introduce the correlation structures and their underlying model assumptions under a mixed-effects regression framework. With practical advice for implementation, we then demonstrate how the correlation parameters can be estimated using examples and we provide programming code in R, SAS, and Stata. An Rshiny app is available that allows investigators to upload an existing dataset and obtain the estimated correlation parameters. We conclude by identifying some gaps in the literature.},

	abstract = {A frequently applied assumption in the analysis of data from cluster randomised trials is that the outcomes from all participants within a cluster are equally correlated. That is, the intracluster correlation, which describes the degree of dependence between outcomes from participants in the same cluster, is the same for each pair of participants in a cluster. However, recent work has discussed the importance of allowing for this correlation to decay as the time between the measurement of participants in a cluster increases. Incorrect omission of such a decay can lead to under-powered studies, and confidence intervals for estimated treatment effects can be too narrow or too wide, depending on the characteristics of the design. When planning studies, researchers often rely on previously reported analyses of trials to inform their choice of intracluster correlation. However, most reported analyses of clustered data do not incorporate a correlation decay. Thus, often all that is available are estimates of intracluster correlations obtained under the potentially incorrect assumption of no decay. In this article, we show that it is possible to use intracluster correlation values obtained from models that incorrectly omit a decay to inform plausible choices of decaying correlations. Our focus is on intracluster correlation estimates for continuous outcomes obtained by fitting linear mixed models with exchangeable or block-exchangeable correlation structures. We describe how plausible values for decaying correlations may be obtained given these estimated intracluster correlations. An online app is presented that allows users to obtain plausible values of the decay, which can be used at the trial planning stage to assess the sensitivity of sample size and power calculations to decaying correlation structures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While simple Audit \& Feedback (A\&F) has shown modest effectiveness in reducing low-value care, there is a knowledge gap on the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions to support de-implementation efforts. Given the need to make rapid decisions in a context of multiple diagnostic and therapeutic options, trauma is a high-risk setting for low-value care. Furthermore, trauma systems are a favorable setting for de-implementation interventions as they have quality improvement teams with medical leadership, routinely collected clinical data, and performance-linked to accreditation. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for reducing low-value clinical practices in acute adult trauma care.
METHODS: We will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) embedded in a Canadian provincial quality assurance program. Level I-III trauma centers (nâ€‰=â€‰30) will be randomized (1:1) to receive simple A\&F (control) or a multifaceted intervention (intervention). The intervention, developed using extensive background work and UK Medical Research Council guidelines, includes an A\&F report, educational meetings, and facilitation visits. The primary outcome will be the use of low-value initial diagnostic imaging, assessed at the patient level using routinely collected trauma registry data. Secondary outcomes will be low-value specialist consultation, low-value repeat imaging after a patient transfer, unintended consequences, determinants for successful implementation, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
DISCUSSION: On completion of the cRCT, if the intervention is effective and cost-effective, the multifaceted intervention will be integrated into trauma systems across Canada. Medium and long-term benefits may include a reduction in adverse events for patients and an increase in resource availability. The proposed intervention targets a problem identified by stakeholders, is based on extensive background work, was developed using a partnership approach, is low-cost, and is linked to accreditation. There will be no attrition, identification, or recruitment bias as the intervention is mandatory in line with trauma center designation requirements, and all outcomes will be assessed with routinely collected data. However, investigators cannot be blinded to group allocation and there is a possibility of contamination bias that will be minimized by conducting intervention refinement only with participants in the intervention arm.

	issn = {1533-4406},
	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa2300184},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are used to treat acute depression in patients with bipolar I disorder, but their effect as maintenance treatment after the remission of depression has not been well studied.
METHODS: We conducted a multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maintenance of treatment with adjunctive escitalopram or bupropion XL as compared with discontinuation of antidepressant therapy in patients with bipolar I disorder who had recently had remission of a depressive episode. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue treatment with antidepressants for 52 weeks after remission or to switch to placebo at 8 weeks. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was any mood episode, as defined by scores on scales measuring symptoms of hypomania or mania, depression, suicidality, and mood-episode severity; additional treatment or hospitalization for mood symptoms; or attempted or completed suicide. Key secondary outcomes included the time to an episode of mania or hypomania or depression.
RESULTS: Of 209 patients with bipolar I disorder who participated in an open-label treatment phase, 150 who had remission of depression were enrolled in the double-blind phase in addition to 27 patients who were enrolled directly. A total of 90 patients were assigned to continue treatment with the prescribed antidepressant for 52 weeks (52-week group) and 87 were assigned to switch to placebo at 8 weeks (8-week group). The trial was stopped before full recruitment was reached owing to slow recruitment and funding limitations. At 52 weeks, 28 of the patients in the 52-week group (31\%) and 40 in the 8-week group (46\%) had a primary-outcome event. The hazard ratio for time to any mood episode in the 52-week group relative to the 8-week group was 0.68 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.10; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.12 by log-rank test). A total of 11 patients in the 52-week group (12\%) as compared with 5 patients in the 8-week group (6\%) had mania or hypomania (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 6.08), and 15 patients (17\%) as compared with 35 patients (40\%) had recurrence of depression (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.25 to 0.75). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In a trial involving patients with bipolar I disorder and a recently remitted depressive episode, adjunctive treatment with escitalopram or bupropion XL that continued for 52 weeks did not show a significant benefit as compared with treatment for 8 weeks in preventing relapse of any mood episode. The trial was stopped early owing to slow recruitment and funding limitations. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00958633.).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07248},
	abstract = {Linear mixed models are commonly used in analyzing stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs). A key consideration for analyzing a SW-CRT is accounting for the potentially complex correlation structure, which can be achieved by specifying a random effects structure. Common random effects structures for a SW-CRT include random intercept, random cluster-by-period, and discrete-time decay. Recently, more complex structures, such as the random intervention structure, have been proposed. In practice, specifying appropriate random effects can be challenging. Robust variance estimators (RVE) may be applied to linear mixed models to provide consistent estimators of standard errors of fixed effect parameters in the presence of random-effects misspecification. However, there has been no empirical investigation of RVE for SW-CRT. In this paper, we first review five RVEs (both standard and small-sample bias-corrected RVEs) that are available for linear mixed models. We then describe a comprehensive simulation study to examine the performance of these RVEs for SW-CRTs with a continuous outcome under different data generators. For each data generator, we investigate whether the use of a RVE with either the random intercept model or the random cluster-by-period model is sufficient to provide valid statistical inference for fixed effect parameters, when these working models are subject to misspecification. Our results indicate that the random intercept and random cluster-by-period models with RVEs performed similarly. The CR3 RVE estimator, coupled with the number of clusters minus two degrees of freedom correction, consistently gave the best coverage results, but could be slightly anti-conservative when the number of clusters was below 16. We summarize the implications of our results for linear mixed model analysis of SW-CRTs in practice.},
