  abstract = {PURPOSE: Learners, either medical students or residents, often perform the initial assessment of patients visiting the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, if learners affect the rate of short-term unscheduled return visits. The objective of this study was to determine if the involvement of learners in ED visits increases the rate of return visits.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of ED visit data at a single tertiary care centre over a 1-year period. Return visits were defined as those presenting within 72Â h of discharge from an initial non-admit ED visit and resulting in an admission on the second visit. A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine the odds ratios of return visits, adjusting for prespecified co-variates, with and without learners involved during the initial visit. Secondary analyses assessed for associations between learner level of training, program of study and return visits.
RESULTS: Return visits occurred after 658 (1.3\%) of 51,149 encounters involving learners and 701 (0.8\%) of 83,310 encounters with no learner involvement. Involvement of learners in ED initial visits was not associated with increased odds of return visits (adjusted OR 1.13 [95\% CI 0.71-1.81]), although the point estimates were heterogeneous over learner level of training, with clerkship students (medical student years 3 and 4) and senior residents (post-graduate years 4 and 5) trending towards reduced odds of a return visit. Resident program of study did not independently predict return visits.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the involvement of learners in ED patient assessments is not associated with increased odds of short-term unscheduled return visits.},
