# Pragmatic clinical trials

My program of research is about developing methods in design and analysis of randomized controlled trials. The details of my research are:


- [x] **Practical issues in cluster randomized trials**
  - Design issues in cluster randomized trials
  - Analytically models in longitudinal cluster randomized trials (e.g., Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials)
  - Clustered/longitudinal data analysis
  
- [x] **Bayesian platform and adaptive trials**
  - Optimize trial design
  - Bayesian inference in clinical trials
  - Bayesian prior elicitation


# Quasi-experimental design
- [x] **Interrupted time-series design**
  - Multiple baseline interrupted time-series (MBITS) design 
  - Analytical models in MBITS


# Statistical Consulting
- [x] **Impact in healthcare**
  - Emergency medicine
  - Cardiovascular risk
  - Mental health: depression and mood disorder
  - Canada Choosing Wisely
  - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)
