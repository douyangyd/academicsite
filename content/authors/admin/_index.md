Dr. Yongdong Ouyang is a PhD Biostatistician at the [IMPaCT](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/heath/) (Innovative Methods in Paediatric Clinical Trials) Lab in [SickKids Research Institute](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/). He has a Ph.D. in [Epideiology and Biostatistics](https://spph.ubc.ca/about/epidemiology-biostatistics-and-public-health/) from the School of Population and Public Health ([SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/)) at the University of British Columbia ([UBC](http://www.ubc.ca/)), supervised by Dr. Hubert Wong. Before joining SickKids, he served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Clinical Epidemiology program at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute ([OHRI](https://www.ohri.ca/home.asp)), supervised by Dr. Monica Taljaard.

Dr. Ouyang's current research focuses on the development of novel statistical approaches for the design and analysis of clinical trials, with particular emphasis on cluster randomized and Bayesian trials. He also conducts research in observational studies using quasi-experimental designs. Furthermore, he actively engages in scientific collaborations in Canada and internationally and contributes his expertise to various projects as a Statistician.
